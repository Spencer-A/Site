      <h1>Citizenship</h1>
      <h2>How can I be a good citizen?</h2>
      <p id="def">Citizenship: "the quality of an individual's response to membership in a community" [1]</p>
      <p>We are all part of several communities, and it is our job to serve those communites
        through citizenship. However, being a good citizen-consistently doing what is best for the
        community-is sometimes much easier than other times. Thus, the true test of citizenship
        comes when it is hard, not when it is easy. Thus, many traits are necessary to be a good
        ciitzen, such as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Honesty: Conducting yourself in a fair, sincere manner. To be deceitful is almost always
        done to cause harm of some kind, and thus when a member of a community is dishonest, it negatively
        impacts said entire community</li>
        <li>Compassion: Being sensitive and attentive to other peopleâ€™s struggles. In a communinity
        it is necessary to care for those that are not well, and that often requires sympathy
        regarding how others are struggling</li>
        <li>Respect: Having a fundamental appreciation for people just because they are
        human beings. Communities are diverse groups, and without basic respect for everyone in it
        the community will splinter and suffer</li>
        <li>Responsibility: Accountability for your own self. You occupy a specific place in a community,
        and you must be trustworthy and accountable to successfully fulfill that role</li>
        <li>Courage: Willingness to put yourself in uncomfortable situations. This attribute
        is necessary in citizenship because if you are only willing to be a citizen during
        comfortable times, that is not true citizenship</li>
        <li>Selflessness: Putting the well-being of others above your own comfort (to a reasonable
        degree). If you want to consistently do what is best for the community, that will often
        require you to put its needs and wellbeing over your own comfort</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Recently, I have been following the actions of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). For decades,
      this organization has been a principled group actively practicing their citizenship in the community that in
      the United States. I am constantly inspired by their role in actively fighting for American democracy and their
      characteristics of honesty, compassion, respect, responsibility, courage, and selflessness</p>
