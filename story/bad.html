    <h1>Bad Ending</h1>
    <p>Wheter it is intentional or not, you fall asleep. Thus you don't edit the
      movie. You show up at school
      without a finished project. Your group is severely disappointed in you,
      especially Dubnium. As you are called to present, you sheepishly admit to the
      teachers that you don't have anything. They scold you and fail you: ruining
      your previously perfect grades in latin.</p>
