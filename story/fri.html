    <p>You are woken up by Erbium calling you at 8:23. You are over 20 minutes
    late. You get your stuff together quickly and drive over there. When you
    arrive, you realize that Ununquadium isn’t there, and Erbium tells you that
    nunquadium can’t make it for a few hours. <br><br>
    Do you wait a few hours to film with him, film now without him, or film Monday?
