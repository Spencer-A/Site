    <h1>Good Ending</h1>
    <p>You are responsible and start editing as soon as you can. Whether
      you already have good footage to start with or not, you do a great job.
      Your fellow students love it so much they unanimously vote it as best movie.
      The teachers love it too. Your group is immensely proud
      of you, and you continue to keep your perfect latin grades.</p>
